D3 is short for Data-Driven Documents. Murry defines it in his book, <i>Interactive Data Visualization for the Web</i>, 
as “a JavaScript library for creating data visualizations” (p. 7). The core of the D3 algorithm is making data bind to elements within the web page so that the data can be manipulated (Murry, p. 67).
Various commands can be used in combination, called a chain, to bind and send commands to the web page.

<p>
The “.select” command allows us to choose which element of the code we want to manipulate. It references the first element it matches (p. 71).
</p>
<p>
The “.append” command will create the a new element that we specify at the end of whichever element we previously selected (p. 71).
</p>
<p>
The “.text” command will insert a string between the opening and closing tags of the element noted in the previous .append command. If there is “existing content, it will be overwritten [emphasis mine]” (p. 72).
</p>
<p>
Murry goes on to point out the importance of order in ensuring elements are implemented correctly.
